Conditional Results — Chronos / EntropyDepth

This document lists results that are explicitly conditional.
No statement here is asserted unconditionally.

--------------------------------------------------
Hypotheses
--------------------------------------------------

H1 Locality:
Refinement procedures are FO^k-admissible with fixed k.

H2 Bounded Information Loss:
Each refinement step incurs O(1) conditional mutual information loss.

H3 Residual Entropy Persistence:
Adaptive refinement preserves Ω(n) residual entropy unless depth is Ω(n).

--------------------------------------------------
Conditional Results
--------------------------------------------------

• EntropyDepth lower bounds of order Ω(n) under H1–H3.
• Incompatibility of polynomial-time refinement with H1–H3 simultaneously.
• Depth lower bounds for any refinement-only SAT strategy.
• Necessity of global or non-local mechanisms to evade entropy growth.

Each item holds only under the hypotheses stated above.
