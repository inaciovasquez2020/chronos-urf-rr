[Referee Map](REFEREE.md) · Explicit Claims Classification

This repository contains the research implementation and analysis for Chronos Universal Reference Frame (URF) Relative Rigidity. It is an indexed component of the Vasquez research ecosystem.

## Overview
The `chronos-urf-rr` module provides the computational logic and mathematical modeling for relative rigidity within the Chronos framework, serving as a key analytical layer of the URF environment.

## Canonical Registry
This repository is a registered module of the Vasquez Index. Stable references, archival DOIs, and reproducibility links are maintained at:
* [Vasquez Index Dashboard](https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/vasquez-index/dashboard.html)

## Repository Status
* **Repository Handle:** inaciovasquez2020/chronos-urf-rr
* **DOI Reference:** [10.5281/zenodo.18403707](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18403707)
