# Implementation Binding Witnesses (Chronos / URF / Radiative Rigidity)

This repository contains three independent witnesses S0 with CI verification:
- Chronos: entropy-audit scaffold for ED(F_n) lower bounds (interface + tests).
- URF: Lean scaffold for a certified spectral gap statement.
- Radiative Rigidity: PCA rank-1 test scaffold (interface + tests).

CI runs: Python tests + (optional) Lean build if Lean toolchain is installed.
