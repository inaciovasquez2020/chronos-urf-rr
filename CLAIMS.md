Claims Policy — Chronos / EntropyDepth

This repository uses strict claims discipline.

• Unconditional claims are listed only in docs/referee/PROVEN_RESULTS.md.
• Conditional claims appear only with explicit hypotheses.
• Framework statements are non-claim reductions or normalizations.
• No Clay Millennium Problem is claimed solved.
• No empirical or heuristic argument is elevated to proof.

Any statement not listed as unconditional is conditional or non-assertive by default.
